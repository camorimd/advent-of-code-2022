# Introduction
In the example folders you will find my attempt at the [Advent of Code 2022][adventofcode] 

You will not find efficient code, I'm trying to use as many language features as I can. Even if it means coding *MUSK* style (*aka* verbose as hell).

Also I'm trying to use the least amount possible of external crates, nonetheless I didn't wanted to rewrite the intersection routine of two vectors, so... array_tool is included in the `Cargo.toml`

**Don't** expect the comments in the code to be accurate, sorry I have a tendency to refactor a lot, and I usually forget to delete comments :(

If there's something that you don't understand about the code, let me know in the issues and I'll try my best to respond, nonetheless I'm no Rust expert.
